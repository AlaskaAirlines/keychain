## Overview

> Supports iOS only.  

Keychain is a wrapper library built around a small subset of features offered by Keychain Services to simplify saving and retrieving data to and from the iOS Keychain using `kSecClassGenericPassword` class.

While the Keychain Services offer comprehensive set of APIs and could be used directly, the app-side implementation for saving and retrieving data will most likely be verbose.

In a nutshell, to securely store an item using Keychain Services, a dictionary of predefined keys and values, also referred to as the _keychain query_, must be created first. This query must contain valid values for predefined set of keys that depend on a security class being used. To reduce the amount of manual work required to create a keychain query, this framework takes advantage of Swift features such as default implementation for protocols, generics and `Codable` for automatic encoding of models into external representation.

This approach leads to a much cleaner interaction with iOS Keychain that's enjoyable to use.

## Requirements
* iOS 10.0+
* Xcode 9.0+
* Swift 4.0+


## Installation
Carthage is the only supported way to install Keychain framework.

```
git "https://github.com/AlaskaAirlines/keychain" "v1.0.0"
```

For more information on getting started with Carthage, visit the [repo](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).


## Usage
Keychain framework currently supports two access types - App Specific and Group Specific. The iCloud sync support across multiple devices will be added later.

Getting started is easy. First, create the keychain instance using one of the supported access types.

```
let keychain = Keychain(access: .appSpecific(serviceName: "App"))
```

Any custom type you want to encrypt and store in iOS Keychain needs to conform and implement the `KeychainItem` protocol. The `KeychainItem` protocol provides default implementation for all of its properties - except the `idKey`. See documentation for more information.

```
struct User: KeychainItem {
    let username: String
    let password: String

    // MARK: KeychainItem

    var idKey: String {
        return username
    }
}
```

Keychain offers a handful of methods that will allow you to save, delete, or retrieve items.

```
let user = User(username: "username", password: "password")

// save
try? keychain.save(user)

// retrieve users
let users = try? keychain.items(ofType: User.self)

// retrieve a single user
let user = try? keychain.item(ofType: User.self, idKey: "username")
```

For group specific configuration, please see documentation.


## Performance
The following tests were performed on an iPad Mini 4 WiFi + Cellular. The numbers are the average for performing each operation 3000 times.

* Deleting: 0.00662
* Inserting: 0.00862
* Reading: 0.00291
* Replacing: 0.00858
